# Frontend
Our frontend AKA webpage used React.js framework to help us build up the webpage(up to now, maybe we will change our frontend some day).

# Backend
As our coursework requirements, we have to use Google App Engine service with Python as our backend, it means, at last, we will deploy our project into the cloud.
